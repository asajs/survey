# survey

This project is to enable professors at BYU-I allow students to grade each other's presentations and provide each other feedback.
The advantage of the program is that it will automatically combine the results.

The survey resides on Qualtrics, and a API token and a survey ID are required. This is obtainable via the control panel under your username. You may not have the necessary permissions to get a token, instructions on obtaining one are on the Qualtric's website.

Instructions are under the respective file.
